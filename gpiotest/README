Port test for ci20 dev board.

This software is designed to test a ci20 primary and secondary expansion ports
The test is performed from a second ci20 board connected to the test target

Run the tests by executing the following steps:

1 Connect the two boards expansion ports with an IDC ribbon cables
  Ensuring a 1 to 1 connection

2 Connect the two boards serial ports for the comms (ttyS4) TX->RX & RX->TX

3 Login to the test target and set the ttyS4 port (see below)
  Start bash with io redirected to ttyS4

4 Login to the testing ci20 and set the ttyS4 port
  run the genrep.sh script


==============================================
Set comms serial ports on both boards with the following commands

$ sleep 99999 > /dev/ttyS4 &       # keeps the port open
$ stty < /dev/ttyS4 115200 raw
$ stty < /dev/ttyS4 -echo -echok -echoe
$ stty < /dev/ttyS4 nl

Test the comms link with the following commands

$ cat /dev/ttyS4 &
$ echo ls > /dev/ttyS4

You should see the output from the ls command which ran on the remote ci20
After testing the comms don't forget to "kill the cat"
